## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My Name is Max and I am a software engineer located in Germany.

I am currently studying for my master's degree in applied computer science.

Besides studying for university I am interested in learning new things and expand my knowledge and skills in development.

### Fun facts:
- I don't like coffee.
- Outside of tech I really enjoy playing football
